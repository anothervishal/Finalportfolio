In this blog post, we will explore these 8 core drives and how they can be applied in different contexts.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-epic-meaning-calling\">1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling<\/h4>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph \">The first core drive of gamification is Epic Meaning &amp; Calling. This core drive is about creating a sense of purpose and meaning in the activity. When people feel that what they are doing is meaningful and has a purpose, they are more motivated to engage in it. This core drive can be applied to different contexts, such as education, where students are given a sense of purpose and meaning by connecting what they are learning to real-world problems.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-development-accomplishment\"> 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment<\/h4>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph \">The second core drive is Development &amp; Accomplishment. This core drive is about providing a sense of progress and achievement. People are motivated when they feel that they are making progress and achieving their goals. This core drive can be applied to different contexts, such as fitness, where people are motivated by seeing progress in their workouts and achieving their fitness goals.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-empowerment-of-creativity-feedback\">3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback<\/h4>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph \">The third core drive is the Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback. This core drive is about providing opportunities for creativity and feedback. People are motivated when they have the freedom to be creative and express themselves, and when they receive feedback that helps them improve. This core drive can be applied to different contexts, such as business, where employees are empowered to be creative and receive feedback that helps them improve their performance.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-ownership-possession\">4: Ownership &amp; Possession<\/h4>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph \">The fourth core drive is Ownership &amp; Possession. This core drive is about creating a sense of ownership and possession. People are motivated when they feel that they have control over something and that it belongs to them. This core drive can be applied to different contexts, such as marketing, where customers are motivated to purchase products when they feel that they own them.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-social-influence-relatedness\">5: Social Influence &amp; Relatedness<\/h4>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph \">The fifth core drive is Social Influence &amp; Relatedness. This core drive is about the desire to connect with others and to be part of a community. People are motivated when they feel that they belong to a group and that their actions are valued by others. This core drive can be applied to different contexts, such as education, where students are motivated by being part of a community of learners.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-scarcity-impatience\">6: Scarcity &amp; Impatience<\/h4>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph \">The sixth core drive is Scarcity &amp; Impatience. This core drive is about creating a sense of urgency and scarcity. People are motivated when they feel that something is scarce and that they need to act quickly to get it. This core drive can be applied to different contexts, such as sales, where customers are motivated to purchase a product when they feel that it is in high demand and in short supply.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-unpredictability-curiosity\">7: Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity<\/h4>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph \">The seventh core drive is Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity. This core drive is about creating a sense of curiosity and surprise. People are motivated when they encounter something unexpected and when they are curious to find out what happens next. This core drive can be applied to different contexts, such as entertainment, where people are motivated to watch a movie or read a book when they feel that it is unpredictable and surprising.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-loss-avoidance\">8: Loss &amp; Avoidance<\/h4>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph \">The eighth and final core drive is Loss &amp; Avoidance. It is the drive to avoid negative outcomes or losses. Gamification can leverage this core drive by providing consequences for inaction or failure. By creating a sense of urgency and fear of loss, gamification can motivate people to take action and avoid negative outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph \">Overall, understanding these eight core drives of gamification can help businesses and organizations design engaging and motivating experiences for their users. By tapping into these core drives, gamification can create meaningful and lasting engagement that drives behavior change and helps users achieve their goals.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gamification is the process of applying game design elements to non-game contexts, such as education, marketing, and business.
